Truck

Defines the Truck class used to simulate the delivery trucks.
Each truck has:
  - A unique truck ID.
  - A departure time (as a timedelta from 8:00 AM).
  - A maximum capacity of 16 packages.
  - A current location and mileage tracker.
  - A driver (assigned from driver.py).
  - Methods for loading packages, delivering packages, and returning to the hub.
